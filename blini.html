Blini

</head>

<p1>
Blini is a traditional Russian recipe! I spent a semester abroad in Russia and my host mother would make me blini for dessert...and sometimes breakfast! It was my favorite meal and I strongly encourage everyone to make it. 
I found the original recipe <a href="https://www.littlebroken.com/easiest-delicious-russian-crepes-blini/">here</a>. 
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs
<li>2 cups of milk at room temperature (not hot, not cold)
<li>1 tbsp sugar
<li>1/3 tsp salt
<li>1/2 tsp salt
<li>1/2 tsp baking soda
<li>1 tbsp veggie oil
<li>2 tbsp melted butter
<li>1 cup flour
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract
</ul>
<h4>
To make:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Whisk together the eggs and then add milk. Whisk until blended.
<li>Add sugar, salt, baking soda, veggie oil and butter. Mix all ingredients. 
<li>Gradually add the flour and mix well until no lumps are visible.
<li>Heat a medium non-stick pan over medium heat. Spray with Pam. 
<li>Add about a 1/4 cup of the batter to the pan.
<li>let cook for about 40 seconds on each side (this is what we found worked for us).
</ol>

We found that the best way to flip it was to do it quickly. Try to make sure that the top is not too liquid-y before flipping -- this is why we left it longer than the recommend 30 seconds. Try to make as clean of a flip as possible but don't feel discouraged if it takes some practice! We had quite a few ugly blini before some pretty ones.

We served our blini with jam. I spread the jam on it when it was flat and then folded it into triangles. See imagine below! When I was in Russia, my host mother would make me blini with chocolate. We haven't tried that yet, but we plan to!
