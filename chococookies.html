Chocolate Chip Cookies

<p1>
The chocolate chip cookies we make are exactly the recipe on the back of the Toll House chocolate chip bag! We have found that this is a tried and true recipe to go by. 
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 1/4 cups flour
<l1>1 tsp baking soda
<li>1 tsp salt
<li>1 cup butter softened 
<li>3/4 cup sugar
<li>3/4 cup brown sugar
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract
<li>2 eggs
<li>2 cups of the Nestle Toll House chocolate chips
<li> if you want you can add 1 cup of chopped nuts, though we've never done this
</ul>
We did substitute M&Ms for the chocolate chips and love it! I'm itching to try PB M&Ms but have not yet. 
<h4>
To make:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 and prepare an ungraded baking sheet.
<li>In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.
<li>In a larger mixing bowl (all the dough will end up here) beat the sugars, butter and vanilla extract until creamy.
<li>Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat each one until thoroughly mixed and creamy.
<li>Gradually add in the flour mixture -- beat thoroughly before adding additional flour mixture.
<li>Stir in choco chips and nuts.
<li>Drop onto baking sheet with a spoon. Bake 9-11 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. 
<li> Remember to let cool on either drying rack or wax paper for at least 3 minutes. 
</ol>

We have loved these chocolate chip cookies! The butter makes them nice and soft. Yum!
