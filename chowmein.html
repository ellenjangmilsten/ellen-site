Chow Mein
</h2>
</head>

<p1>
Chow Mien was my favorite dish that my mom made when I was young. Though it seems silly now, I never conceptualized that I could make it for myself now that I'm out on my own! I have been delighted by my ability to do so and each time I make it, I'm reminded of my childhood days eating in the living room with my family. 
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are: 
</h4>
<ul>
<li> 1 or 2 packs of Chinese Noodles
<li>Soy sauce to taste 
<li>Sesame seed oil to taste
<li>1 1/2 cups of veggie broth (or chicken or beef)
<li>2 tbsp flour 
<li>Red peper flakes to taste
<li>half a bag of snow pea pods
<li>1 green paper, diced
<li>1 red peper, diced
<li>1 onion, diced
<li>1 can of water chestnuts, drained
<li>1 can of bamboo shoots, drained
<li>bok choy, if wanted 
</ul>
You can always add more veggies if you'd like! These are the veggies that we enjoy the most but plenty of other veggies would work well. 

We recommend using a spaghetti pot for the noodles and a 6 quart pot for the veggies. Eventually, you'll add the noddles and the broth to the veggie pot so it needs to be big enough to hold everything! Plus, you'll need to stir it. 

We did two bags of noodles and had PLENTY of leftovers. We'll likely be able to eat it for a couple more days so keep that in mind. 
<h4>
To make:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Begin with bringing a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. When boiling, add noodles to pot.
<li>Follow cooking instructions on your pasta! Do not over cook as they will cook a little longer when added to veggies. 
<li> Once your noodles are done, drain, rinse and set aside in a bowl. Mix in a little sesame seed oil to prevent your noodles from sticking. 
<li>Cover the bottom of your veggie pan with a very thin layer of veggie oil and heat. 
<li>Once heated, add onion and peppers. Saute. 
<li>Add soy sauce, sesame seed oil and red pepper flakes to allow a bit of marinating. 
<li>Once the onion and peppers are cooked, add in snap peas, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. 
<li>Once all veggies are heated, add in noodles and begin mixing. 
<li>Whisk together the veggie broth and flour to create a thicker broth. Add it to the pot of noodles and vegetables. 
<li>Stir completely. Add in more soy sauce, red pepper flakes and sesame seed oil to taste.
<li> Once you're happy with the consistence of your chow mein, you're done! 
</ol>

I personally like my chow mein to have a bit of broth in it so I don't let it simmer for too long. The longer it sits in the pan, the more the broth will burn off. The amount of flavor is totally up to you so I recommend taste testing frequently as you add in more soy sauce etc.
