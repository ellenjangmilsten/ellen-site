Mexican Fried Rice
</h2>
</head>
<p1>
Henry's mom is the curator of this dish for us! We like to eat it with refried beans and tortillas! 
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>1.5 cups rice, rinsed 3 times
<li>3 cups veggie broth
<li>8oz can tomato sauce
<li>1 green pepper, diced 
<li>1 red pepper, diced 
<li>1 small potato, diced 
<li>1 clove garlic, minced
</ul>
<h4>
To make:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat a medium sized skillet with veggie oil.
<li>Once hot, add in all of the vegetables and the rice.
<li>Sauce until the onions are clear and the rice is getting toasty (you'll know).
<li>Add in the veggie broth. Let the veggies cooks for a couple minutes.
<li>Add in the tomato sauce (and any frozen items) and stir around. 
<li>Bring the dish to a simmer and let cook for 25 minutes with a lid.
<li>Once the rice has absorbed the liquid, it's done!
</ol>

We have noticed that it doesn't always take the full 25 minutes for it to cook. Keep an eye on it as the liquid might be soaked up much quicker than anticipated. Try not to let the rice burn to the bottom!
