<h2>
Banana Bread
</h2>
</head>

<p1>
This was a spur of the moment baking decision when we realized we kept letting our bananas get too old. The original recipe is found <a href="https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/best-banana-bread-recipe/"> here</a>. We modified it a little but mainly stayed true!
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 ripe bananas (the recipe calls for 3 but we only had 2)
<li>1 stick of butter
<li>2 eggs
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract
<li>2 cups of flour
<li>1 cup of sugar
<li>1 tsp baking soda
<li>1/2 tsp salt
<li>1 tsp cinnamon (I probably added more. The recipe calls for 1/2 tsp which I did...and then dumped in some more due to our missing banana)
</ul>
Again, this is another super easy recipe that has a longer wait time till consumption. Make sure it cooks long enough! 
<h4>
To make:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350 and spray a bread pan with Pam (or a diff cooking oil).
<li>In a large mixing bowl, melt your butter in the microwave.
<li>Once melted, remove from microwave and add the bananas to the bowl to mash together with a fork.
<li>Add the vanilla and eggs to this bowl. Mix/mash together till there are no yellow streaks of egg and it looks thoroughly mixed. 
<li>In a different bowl mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. 
<li>Add the wet and dry ingredients together and thoroughly mix with a spatula. 
<li>Once the batter is combined, pour into a bread pan! 
<li> Bake for 45-60 minutes.
</ol>

We ended up baking ours for around 65 minutes. We started checking it around the 50 minute mark and continued checking every 5 minutes until the knife came out clean. We hypothesize that our oven does not cook very quickly so we recommend keeping an eye on it once you get to the 45 minute mark. Next time we make this, we're planning to add chocolate chips!
