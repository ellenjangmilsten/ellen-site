<h2>
Fried Rice
</h2>
</head>

<p1>
I call this one fried rice because it's not Mexican. So, it's simply fried rice. This one is very similar to the chow mein dish! One of my good friends encouraged me to try it!  
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>1.5 cups of rice, rinsed 3 times 
<li>3 cups of veggie broth 
<li>Sesame seed oil, to taste
<li>Soy sauce, to taste
<li>1 onion, diced
<li>1 green pepper, diced
<li>1 red pepper, diced
<li>1 head of broccoli florets 
<li>1 can of Chinese stir fry corn, drained
<li>1 can of water chestnuts, drained
<li>1 can of bamboo shoots, drained 
<li>1 clove of garlic, minced
</ul>
Again, this is a dish where you can add any veggies you think you'll like! I use a 6 quart pot for the veggies because you'll need to add all the rice to it. 
<h4>
To make:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make the rice first. Add the rice to water and let cook for about 20 minutes or until ready. Set aside when done. 
<li>In a 6 quart pot, add veggie oil and let heat.
<li>Once heated, saut√© the onions, peppers, garlic, and broccoli.
<li>Add soy sauce and sesame seed oil to taste.
<li>Once the onions are clear and the broccoli is tender enough to eat, add in water chestnuts, corn and bamboo shoots. 
<li>Once warm, add in the rice and stir. 
<li>Add more soy sauce as necessary until you've reached your desire flavor.
</ol>
