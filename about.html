Welcome to my about me page! Here you'll learn a bit about me and my coding journey. I'll update this page with posts as I learn new code or as significant things happen in my life.
I graduated from Harvard in 2018 with a degree in Philosophy. I adored my time in the philosophy department and believe that the logic skills I learned there have proven useful for my coding journey. I don't read a smuch philosophy as I use to but I still find myself thinking analytically and wishing I had someone to debate with (besides Henry, of course). Maybe eventually I'll feel complelled to give my thoughts their own blog post. 
<br>
<br>
I recently moved in to a studio with my partner Henry in Boston. We don't have a ton of space but we've really enjoyed creating a cozy little home. While Covid has put a lot us in more difficult situations, I will say that one of the positives is that Henry and I have been able to spend most nights cooking together. Hence, all of our recipes! As we try more things I will continue to update this website. 
I work a day job in retail and have begun my moonlighting career in code. Please wish me luck as I go along!

I've tried to learn to code multiple times but only in my latest attempt has it stuck. I'm working through the freecodecamp.org curriculum, linked <a href="freecodecamp.org">here</a>. What I like most about it is that it just jumps right in to coding. The abstract "behind the scenes" information was too overwhelming for me. But learning the basics of html was a much more exciting and digestable intro. 

This website will serve as my playground for code. As I learn more, I will update the website with my new skills. I'm doing this in part because I think it will help me keep trucking along if I have a projet to work on. I'm also doing it so that my friends and family can see my coding skills develop in real time. 

I currently only know the basics of html but have found it to be very enjoyable. It is pretty starughtforward and the commands seem very logical. If I want my website to have a title, I simply need to tell it where the title starts and where it ends. 
<h4>
Poof! Ta da! Easy.
</h4>
I know how to link external links and internal links. All of the different pages of my website are internally linked while the outside websites are externally linked. The internal links are the most itneresting to me because when clinked on, the computer knows to find the file with the corresponding name. It's not taking you to a new webpage, merely pulling up a new file! 

As I'm sure you've noticed, images are also something I learned how to insert. As soon as I figured out how to create a url for my images, it was easy! If you're interested in using image urls yourself, I recommend using PostImage, linked <a href="postimage.cc"> here</a>. 

Next up for me is learning CSS so that I can get my website looking a bit better!

I finished the CSS intro unit today! As I'm sure you've noticed, I added in borders and text color. I even changed the font of this post! 
<br>
<br>
Most of the CSS skills were how to manipulate the html I have on the page already. Most of it was very easy to digest as it's simply telling my html what color to be or what font to be. Border were easy to create but I found them a little more difficult to manipulate. In order to "place" your borders, you have to adjust the padding and margin on them. The padding is what's between the text inside of the border and the border. The margin is the space between the edge of the page and the border. You can either use flat measurements to move it or you can use percentages. I'm honestly not totally sure how either one works, but I found percentage to be easier. I found it easier to visualize my border being 2% away from the edge of the page and my text being 2% away from my border.
<br>
<br>
I was also able to change the size and shape of my photos. Now, you don't need to see a giant photo of me and Henry. It's smaller and cuter (in my opinion). 
<br>
<br>
Most of the other stuff I learned pertained to different ways to do the same thing. For example, there are many ways to assign a color. You can type a basic color name, you can use the RGB spectrum or you can use Hex Code. None of this made a ton of sense to me so I'm going to stick to the basics for now. 
There are also multiple ways to priortize different styles and override styles. Again, a little confusing as to why I need all these ways but I assume I'll learn why later down the road (and wish I had paid more attention). 
<br>
<br>
My final note is more of a note to myself than to you. There is an element called a "root" element. I believe is works as a sort of overarching element that controls the document. For example, if I were to put a variable within that root, it would take effect everyone the variable is menitoned. I'm not totally sure of the purpose yet but I do think it's important.

It's been a while! I took a break from practice because work has been tiring and I couldn't quite get myself to come home and learn. For a couple days I was bringing my computer to work to practice during my lunch break but that too became a bit tiresome. However, tomorrow I will try again! 
<br>
<br>
Tonight I've been developing my css skills a bit more. I didn't realize at the end of the previous lessons that the following lessons were all about text and formating for webpages. I likely would not have done all the changes to my recipe pages had I known. I guess it was good practice though...
<br>
<br>
Anyways, now I'm learning quicker ways to transfrom my text. For example, I can do inline transformations to make things <strong>bold</strong>, or <i>italic</i>, or even <u>underlined</u>. <s>Strike-through</s> was also taught.
<hr>
<div id="capital">
While it is easier to do these shortcuts for particular words, I do still like being able to assign classes to different elements and have the changes affect all of it. For example, this element can become all capital letters if I create and assign a class telling it to do so. Additionally, I will give this paragraph a background color so that it stands out compared to the rest of the text. 
</div>
<br>
<hr>
<div id="textstyle">
Thankfully, I won't stick with that. Reading all those capital letters was a little terrible for me. Likely was for you too. In this paragraph I'll play with the shape of my text! I can adjust the height and the width of my letters. Additioanlly, I can change the space in between my lines. If you compare this paragraph to the one above, you'll notice that these lines are more spaced out. Almost as if I made the parapgraph spacing as 1.2 instead of 1. 
<hr>
Henry just pointed out that my lines are a bit too long. For the ideal reading experience, he suggested using shorter paragraph lines. So, we google'd how to do it! We adjusted the line length using "max-width" and then re-centered the page by using "margin:0 auto" which moved the entire border. Hopefully this makes the reading experience a bit better.
