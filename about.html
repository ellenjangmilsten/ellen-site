Welcome to my about me page! Here you'll learn a bit about me and my coding journey. I'll update this page with posts as I learn new code or as significant things happen in my life.
I graduated from Harvard in 2018 with a degree in Philosophy. I adored my time in the philosophy department and believe that the logic skills I learned there have proven useful for my coding journey. I don't read a smuch philosophy as I use to but I still find myself thinking analytically and wishing I had someone to debate with (besides Henry, of course). Maybe eventually I'll feel complelled to give my thoughts their own blog post. 

I recently moved in to a studio with my partner Henry in Boston. We don't have a ton of space but we've really enjoyed creating a cozy little home. While Covid has put a lot us in more difficult situations, I will say that one of the positives is that Henry and I have been able to spend most nights cooking together. Hence, all of our recipes! As we try more things I will continue to update this website. 
I work a day job in retail and have begun my moonlighting career in code. Please wish me luck as I go along!

I've tried to learn to code multiple times but only in my latest attempt has it stuck. I'm working through the freecodeacadmey.org curriculum, linked <a href="freecodeacademy.org">here</a>. What I like most about it is that it just jumps right in to coding. The abstract "behind the scenes" information was too overwhelming for me. But learning the basics of html was a much more exciting and digestable intro. 

This website will serve as my playground for code. As I learn more, I will update the website with my new skills. I'm doing this in part because I think it will help me keep trucking along if I have a projet to work on. I'm also doing it so that my friends and family can see my coding skills develop in real time. 

I currently only know the basics of html but have found it to be very enjoyable. It is pretty starughtforward and the commands seem very logical. If I want my website to have a title, I simply need to tell it where the title starts and where it ends. 
<h4>
Poof! Ta da! Easy.
</h4>
I know how to link external links and internal links. All of the different pages of my website are internally linked while the outside websites are externally linked. The internal links are the most itneresting to me because when clinked on, the computer knows to find the file with the corresponding name. It's not taking you to a new webpage, merely pulling up a new file! 

As I'm sure you've noticed, images are also something I learned how to insert. As soon as I figured out how to create a url for my images, it was easy! If you're interested in using image urls yourself, I recommend using PostImage, linked <a href="postimage.cc"> here</a>. 

Next up for me is learning CSS so that I can get my website looking a bit better.
