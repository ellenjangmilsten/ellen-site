<h2>
Peanut Butter Oatmeal Chocolate Cookies 
</h2>
</head>
<body>
This recipe is super easy and quick! The hardest parts are making sure you don't overbuilt the chocolate sauce and refraining from eating them all before they've properly dried. 
<h4>
The ingredients you'll need are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 cups of sugar
<li>1 stick of butter
<li>1/4 cup of coco (I use the Hershey brand)
<li>1/2 cup of milk (not super picky on type, I've used regular milk as well as oat milk)
<li>3 1/4 cup of old fashioned oatmeal 
<li>1/2 cup of smooth PB
<li>1 tsp of vanilla 
<li> salt to taste (I usually just sprinkle in some, I don't know what difference it makes)
</ul>
<h4>
To make them:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a space on your counter with wax paper. This is where you'll place the cookies to let them dry so make sure it's a space they can stay for a while.
<li> Combine your oats, PB, vanilla extract and salt in a large bowl. Do not stir them together, simply leave them there. Have a spatula ready by the bowl. 
<li>Combine the sugar, butter, coco, and milk in a small sauce pot. Place on a burner on medium heat. As it warms, stir the sauce so that the butter melts. Once it starts to boil, you only want to let it go for a couple minutes! As soon as the butter is melted, remove from heat. 
<li>Immediately pour the sauce into the bowl of oats and stir! Try to have it thoroughly combined as quickly as possible. As you're staring, you should feel it starts to harden together. 
<li>Once it's thoroughly mixed, take a spoon and spoon dollops of the cookie mix onto the wax paper. Keep them separated to form little mounds. 
</ol>

These cookies are so simple to make but a huge hit in my household. Make sure to let them dry for a couple hours (at least). You'll know they're ready to eat when they're hardened and do not split when picked up.
